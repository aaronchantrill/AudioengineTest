The purpose of this project is to come up with a more streamlined audio system
for a voice assistant. The goal is to demonstrate the system listening,
thinking and talking all at the same time through the use of multiple threads.

This attempt uses the original AlsaAudio and pyAudio libraries that Naomi
inherited plugins for from Jasper.ai. I am trying to figure out the minimum
changes required to Naomi to get continuous input/output working.
